        Welcome to Two Tasty Treats! My name is Porter, and I've created a website showcasing two of my favorite dishes, both a dinner
        and a dessert. Although it's only two items, they're some of the best things your oven will have the pleasure of having inside
        it! The dinner is a bunch of large pasta shells stuffed and surrounded by the alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, and mozzarella and
        parmesan cheese. If you like chicken alfredo, you'll love this! The dessert is a very large sandwich. On top of a dessert being
        a sandwich, It's a sweet oatmeal cookie outside, with a super sweet chocolate inside, combining to make something that you don't
        want to eat if you have any cavities. The links to each of these recipes are right below this text. So try it out, and I hope
        you enjoy!

      <h3>Chicken Alfredo w/ Shells</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be for the dinner, a chicken alfredo stuffed large shell recipe. This page will explain what it is, what you need,
        and how to make it. There won't be anything super complicated here, just normal recipe stuff.

      <h3>Deep Dish Oatmeal Bars</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be for the dessert, a sweet, smooth, and chocolatey inside sandwiched between two slabs of oatmeal goodness.
        Again, this page will contain basic recipe things, such as an explanation of what it is, what you need, and how to make it.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        At the bottom of the page I'm going to have pictures of the food and links to their recipes over their pictures.<br>
        It also appears that some of the sides and bottom of the wireframes have been cut. Whereever you see no lines, a line was just a pixel away.
