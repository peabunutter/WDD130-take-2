    <h2>Porter Clark</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Porter. I love to read books, play video games and goof around with friends.<p>
    <p>I'm 17 and have one brother and four sisters. I was born in Oregon and currently live in southeastern idaho.</p>
    <p>I've been a memeber my whole life, and I'm looking to make games and solve problems with the skills I gain from my path in school.</p>
